Thrust is an excellent, one-player, multi-directional shooter computer game written in 1986 by a very clever chap in Cambridge, UK called Jeremy Smith. This is my attempt to recreate his work using JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` tag.

I have licensed the code within this repository under the terms of the MIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT) enabling other users to use the code as they see fit. However, I do not own nor have I seen the source code of the original game, not that I would be able to understand it anyway.

I wrote this code in 2009 and 2010. You can read about this project and find Thrust-related links on my website: https://joncom.be/stuff/thrust/

2023 update!

My original version used a Flash plugin called soundmanager2 to play the in-game audio. Obviously, the demise of Flash broke my game. I missed it (Thrust, not Flash), so I replaced the need for a plugin with native HTML audio. Bang! Bang!

It is incredibly weird looking at old code that you were proud of at the time but would do it all very differently if you were to start again now. I'm glad my `Hungarian notation` days are behind me. :)
