Thrust is an excellent, one player, multi-directional shooter computer game written in 1986 by a very clever chap in Cambridge, UK called Jeremy Smith. This is my attempt to recreate his work using JavaScript and the html <canvas> tag.

I have licensed the code within this repositority under the terms of the MIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT) enabling other users to use the code as they see fit. However I do not own nor have I seen the source code of the original game, not that I would be able to understand anyway.

This code was written in 2009 and 2010. You can read about this project and find Thrust related links on my personal website: http://joncom.be/experiments/thrust/
